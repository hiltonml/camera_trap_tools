PySide2-based time-lapse image viewer.  The main class, ```TLV_ApplicationWindow```, is designed to be used as the base class for new applications that need to incorporate the viewing of time-lapse videos or image sequences.  The file ```testApp.py``` shows an example of how to build an app on top of ```TLV_ApplicationWindow```.
